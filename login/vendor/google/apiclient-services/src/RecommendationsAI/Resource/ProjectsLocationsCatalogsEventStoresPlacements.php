   * to identify the set of models that will be used to make the prediction. We
   * currently support three placements with the following IDs by default: *
   * `shopping_cart`: Predicts items frequently bought together with one or more
   * catalog items in the same shopping session. Commonly displayed after `add-to-
   * cart` events, on product detail pages, or on the shopping cart page. *
   * `home_page`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely engage
   * with or purchase based on the shopping or viewing history of the specified
   * `userId` or `visitorId`. For example - Recommendations for you. *
   * `product_detail`: Predicts the next product that a user will most likely
   * engage with or purchase. The prediction is based on the shopping or viewing
   * history of the specified `userId` or `visitorId` and its relevance to a
   * specified `CatalogItem`. Typically used on product detail pages. For example
   * - More items like this. * `recently_viewed_default`: Returns up to 75 items
   * recently viewed by the specified `userId` or `visitorId`, most recent ones
   * first. Returns nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet. For
   * example - Recently viewed. The full list of available placements can be seen
   * at https://console.cloud.google.com/recommendation/datafeeds/default_catalog/
