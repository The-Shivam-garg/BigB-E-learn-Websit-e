  /**
   * Retrieves a list of activities for a specific customer's account and
   * application such as the Admin console application or the Google Drive
   * application. For more information, see the guides for administrator and
   * Google Drive activity reports. For more information about the activity
   * report's parameters, see the activity parameters reference guides.
   * (activities.listActivities)
   *
   * @param string $userKey Represents the profile ID or the user email for which
   * the data should be filtered. Can be `all` for all information, or `userKey`
   * for a user's unique Google Workspace profile ID or their primary email
   * address. Must not be a deleted user. For a deleted user, call `users.list` in
   * Directory API with `showDeleted=true`, then use the returned `ID` as the
   * `userKey`.
   * @param string $applicationName Application name for which the events are to
   * be retrieved.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string actorIpAddress The Internet Protocol (IP) Address of host
   * where the event was performed. This is an additional way to filter a report's
   * summary using the IP address of the user whose activity is being reported.
   * This IP address may or may not reflect the user's physical location. For
   * example, the IP address can be the user's proxy server's address or a virtual
   * private network (VPN) address. This parameter supports both IPv4 and IPv6
   * address versions.
   * @opt_param string customerId The unique ID of the customer to retrieve data
   * for.
   * @opt_param string endTime Sets the end of the range of time shown in the
   * report. The date is in the RFC 3339 format, for example
   * 2010-10-28T10:26:35.000Z. The default value is the approximate time of the
   * API request. An API report has three basic time concepts: - *Date of the
   * API's request for a report*: When the API created and retrieved the report. -
   * *Report's start time*: The beginning of the timespan shown in the report. The
   * `startTime` must be before the `endTime` (if specified) and the current time
   * when the request is made, or the API returns an error. - *Report's end time*:
   * The end of the timespan shown in the report. For example, the timespan of
   * events summarized in a report can start in April and end in May. The report
   * itself can be requested in August. If the `endTime` is not specified, the
   * report returns all activities from the `startTime` until the current time or
   * the most recent 180 days if the `startTime` is more than 180 days in the
   * past.
   * @opt_param string eventName The name of the event being queried by the API.
   * Each `eventName` is related to a specific Google Workspace service or feature
   * which the API organizes into types of events. An example is the Google
   * Calendar events in the Admin console application's reports. The Calendar
   * Settings `type` structure has all of the Calendar `eventName` activities
   * reported by the API. When an administrator changes a Calendar setting, the
   * API reports this activity in the Calendar Settings `type` and `eventName`
   * parameters. For more information about `eventName` query strings and
   * parameters, see the list of event names for various applications above in
   * `applicationName`.
   * @opt_param string filters The `filters` query string is a comma-separated
   * list. The list is composed of event parameters that are manipulated by
   * relational operators. Event parameters are in the form `parameter1
   * name[parameter1 value],parameter2 name[parameter2 value],...` These event
   * parameters are associated with a specific `eventName`. An empty report is
   * returned if the filtered request's parameter does not belong to the
   * `eventName`. For more information about `eventName` parameters, see the list
   * of event names for various applications above in `applicationName`. In the
   * following Admin Activity example, the <> operator is URL-encoded in the
   * request's query string (%3C%3E): GET...=CHANGE_CALENDAR_SETTING
   * =NEW_VALUE%3C%3EREAD_ONLY_ACCESS In the following Drive example, the list can
   * be a view or edit event's `doc_id` parameter with a value that is manipulated
   * by an 'equal to' (==) or 'not equal to' (<>) relational operator. In the
   * first example, the report returns each edited document's `doc_id`. In the
   * second example, the report returns each viewed document's `doc_id` that
   * equals the value 12345 and does not return any viewed document's which have a
   * `doc_id` value of 98765. The <> operator is URL-encoded in the request's
   * query string (%3C%3E): GET...=edit=doc_id
   * GET...=view=doc_id==12345,doc_id%3C%3E98765 The relational operators include:
   * - `==` - 'equal to'. - `<>` - 'not equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C%3E). -
   * `<` - 'less than'. It is URL-encoded (%3C). - `<=` - 'less than or equal to'.
   * It is URL-encoded (%3C=). - `>` - 'greater than'. It is URL-encoded (%3E). -
   * `>=` - 'greater than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3E=). *Note:* The API
   * doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a particular parameter is
   * supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last
   * value of that request parameter. In addition, if an invalid request parameter
   * is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that request parameter and
   * returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid request parameters.
   * If no parameters are requested, all parameters are returned.
   * @opt_param string groupIdFilter Comma separated group ids (obfuscated) on
   * which user activities are filtered, i.e. the response will contain activities
   * for only those users that are a part of at least one of the group ids
   * mentioned here. Format: "id:abc123,id:xyz456"
   * @opt_param int maxResults Determines how many activity records are shown on
   * each response page. For example, if the request sets `maxResults=1` and the
   * report has two activities, the report has two pages. The response's
   * `nextPageToken` property has the token to the second page. The `maxResults`
   * query string is optional in the request. The default value is 1000.
   * @opt_param string orgUnitID ID of the organizational unit to report on.
   * Activity records will be shown only for users who belong to the specified
   * organizational unit. Data before Dec 17, 2018 doesn't appear in the filtered
   * results.
   * @opt_param string pageToken The token to specify next page. A report with
   * multiple pages has a `nextPageToken` property in the response. In your
   * follow-on request getting the next page of the report, enter the
   * `nextPageToken` value in the `pageToken` query string.
   * @opt_param string startTime Sets the beginning of the range of time shown in
   * the report. The date is in the RFC 3339 format, for example
   * 2010-10-28T10:26:35.000Z. The report returns all activities from `startTime`
   * until `endTime`. The `startTime` must be before the `endTime` (if specified)
   * and the current time when the request is made, or the API returns an error.
