  /**
   * Analyzes IAM policies to answer which identities have what accesses on which
   * resources. (v1.analyzeIamPolicy)
   *
   * @param string $scope Required. The relative name of the root asset. Only
   * resources and IAM policies within the scope will be analyzed. This can only
   * be an organization number (such as "organizations/123"), a folder number
   * (such as "folders/123"), a project ID (such as "projects/my-project-id"), or
   * a project number (such as "projects/12345"). To know how to get organization
   * id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-
   * managing-organization#retrieving_your_organization_id). To know how to get
   * folder or project id, visit [here ](https://cloud.google.com/resource-
   * manager/docs/creating-managing-
   * folders#viewing_or_listing_folders_and_projects).
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param string analysisQuery.accessSelector.permissions Optional. The
   * permissions to appear in result.
   * @opt_param string analysisQuery.accessSelector.roles Optional. The roles to
   * appear in result.
   * @opt_param string analysisQuery.conditionContext.accessTime The hypothetical
   * access timestamp to evaluate IAM conditions. Note that this value must not be
   * earlier than the current time; otherwise, an INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be
   * returned.
   * @opt_param string analysisQuery.identitySelector.identity Required. The
   * identity appear in the form of principals in [IAM policy
   * binding](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/Binding). The
   * examples of supported forms are: "user:mike@example.com",
   * "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-
   * id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com". Notice that wildcard characters (such as *
   * and ?) are not supported. You must give a specific identity.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.analyzeServiceAccountImpersonation
   * Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities
   * to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive
   * operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend
   * you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning rpc instead. For example, if
   * the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's
   * an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission
   * to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service
   * account SA has permission P to a GCP folder F, then user A potentially has
   * access to the GCP folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be
   * included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis.
   * Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a GCP
   * folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has
   * iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there's
   * another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the GCP
   * folder F, then user A potentially has access to the GCP folder F. And those
   * advanced analysis results will be included in
   * AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the
   * following permissions are considered in this analysis: *
   * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` *
   * `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` *
   * `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` *
   * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation` Default is false.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.expandGroups Optional. If true, the
   * identities section of the result will expand any Google groups appearing in
   * an IAM policy binding. If IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.identity_selector is
   * specified, the identity in the result will be determined by the selector, and
   * this flag is not allowed to set. If true, the default max expansion per group
   * is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][]. Default is false.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.expandResources Optional. If true and
   * IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is not specified, the resource
   * section of the result will expand any resource attached to an IAM policy to
   * include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. For example, if the
   * request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and the results
   * include an IAM policy with P on a GCP folder, the results will also include
   * resources in that folder with permission P. If true and
   * IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section
   * of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower
   * in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported.
   * Folder and organization resource cannot be used together with this option.
   * For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a
   * GCP project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who
   * have permission P on that project or any lower resource. If true, the default
   * max expansion per resource is 1000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicy][] and
   * 100000 for AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning][]. Default is false.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.expandRoles Optional. If true, the
   * access section of result will expand any roles appearing in IAM policy
   * bindings to include their permissions. If
   * IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.access_selector is specified, the access section of
   * the result will be determined by the selector, and this flag is not allowed
   * to set. Default is false.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.outputGroupEdges Optional. If true, the
   * result will output the relevant membership relationships between groups and
   * other groups, and between groups and principals. Default is false.
   * @opt_param bool analysisQuery.options.outputResourceEdges Optional. If true,
   * the result will output the relevant parent/child relationships between
   * resources. Default is false.
   * @opt_param string analysisQuery.resourceSelector.fullResourceName Required.
   * The [full resource name] (https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs
   * /resource-name-format) of a resource of [supported resource
   * types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-
   * types#analyzable_asset_types).
   * @opt_param string executionTimeout Optional. Amount of time executable has to
   * complete. See JSON representation of [Duration](https://developers.google.com
   * /protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json). If this field is set with a value less
   * than the RPC deadline, and the execution of your query hasn't finished in the
   * specified execution timeout, you will get a response with partial result.
   * Otherwise, your query's execution will continue until the RPC deadline. If
   * it's not finished until then, you will get a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED error. Default
   * is empty.
   * @opt_param string savedAnalysisQuery Optional. The name of a saved query,
   * which must be in the format of: *
   * projects/project_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id *
   * folders/folder_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id *
   * organizations/organization_number/savedQueries/saved_query_id If both
   * `analysis_query` and `saved_analysis_query` are provided, they will be merged
   * together with the `saved_analysis_query` as base and the `analysis_query` as
   * overrides. For more details of the merge behavior, please refer to the
   * [MergeFrom](https://developers.google.com/protocol-
   * buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.message#Message.MergeFrom.details)
   * page. Note that you cannot override primitive fields with default value, such

   * field presence yet.
