   * syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. *
   * Restriction for the same field must be combined by `OR`. * Restriction for
   * different fields must be combined by `AND`. * Between `(` and `)` there can
   * only be restrictions combined by `OR` for the same field. * A restriction has
   * the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)`
   * for the following fields: - `entityStatus` - `creativeType`. - `dimensions` -
   * `minDuration` - `maxDuration` - `approvalStatus` - `exchangeReviewStatus` -
   * `dynamic` - `creativeId` - `minModifiedTime` - `maxModifiedTime` * The
   * operator must be `HAS (:)` for the following fields: - `lineItemIds` * For
   * `entityStatus`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, `minModifiedTime`,
   * `maxModifiedTime`, and `dynamic`, there may be at most one restriction. * For
   * `dimensions`, the value is in the form of `"{width}x{height}"`. * For
   * `exchangeReviewStatus`, the value is in the form of
   * `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`. * For `minDuration` and `maxDuration`, the value
   * is in the form of `"{duration}s"`. Only seconds are supported with
   * millisecond granularity. * For `minModifiedTime` and `maxModifiedTime`, the
   * value is a unix timestamp (GMT) in seconds. The time filtered is against the
   * update_time field in the creative, which includes system updates to the
   * creative (e.g. creative review updates). * There may be multiple
   * `lineItemIds` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible line
   * item IDs. * There may be multiple `creativeId` restrictions in order to
   * search against multiple possible creative IDs. Examples: * All native
   * creatives: `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_NATIVE"` * All active creatives with
   * 300x400 or 50x100 dimensions: `entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE" AND
   * (dimensions="300x400" OR dimensions="50x100")` * All dynamic creatives that
   * are approved by AdX or AppNexus, with a minimum duration of 5 seconds and
   * 200ms. `dynamic="true" AND minDuration="5.2s" AND (exchangeReviewStatus
   * ="EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED" OR exchangeReviewStatus
   * ="EXCHANGE_APPNEXUS-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED")` * All video creatives that are
   * associated with line item ID 1 or 2: `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_VIDEO" AND
   * (lineItemIds:1 OR lineItemIds:2)` * Find creatives by multiple creative IDs:
   * `creativeId=1 OR creativeId=2` The length of this field should be no more
   * than 500 characters.
   * @opt_param string orderBy Field by which to sort the list. Acceptable values
   * are: * `creativeId` (default) * `createTime` * `mediaDuration` * `dimensions`
   * (sorts by width first, then by height) The default sorting order is
   * ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a suffix "desc" should be
   * added to the field name. Example: `createTime desc`.
   * @opt_param int pageSize Requested page size. Must be between `1` and `100`.
   * If unspecified will default to `100`. Returns error code `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
   * if an invalid value is specified.
   * @opt_param string pageToken A token identifying a page of results the server
   * should return. Typically, this is the value of next_page_token returned from
   * the previous call to `ListCreatives` method. If not specified, the first page
   * of results will be returned.
